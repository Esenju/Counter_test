# Counter_test

This version is used for simulation tests only, that is behavioral simulations. This design will not implement in a pragmatic manner because we did not use the clock divider. We are still to understand why Vivado could not simulate the original design with the clock divider.

A clock divider was used in the original design to reduce the FPGA clock speed to human-perceivable frequency, that way we can observe the LEDs blinking on the actual hardware board.
